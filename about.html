        <p class="about-me-text">
            Although born and raised in the Netherlands, I am currently based in Barcelona, Spain. I have a diverse background with a bachelors degree in Nursing completed in the Netherlands, followed by an MBA  completed in Spain after a couple years of work experience in the Netherlands, Germany and USA. After having enjoyed many different experiences and types of work, none of it seemed like a seamless fit for me, so I started looking at what comes to me naturally and what brings me the most joy. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Coding allows you to be both logical and creative which is a perfect fit for me. Every project starts as a puzzle of which I am creating the pieces. Doing the workshop with SheCodes has allowed me to start getting experience in coding with the main goal to be a full time coder from here on out. Helping people creating websites and applications that they need by doing something that excites me.
